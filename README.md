To make sure my code works correctly and stays secure, I rely heavily on testing with JUnit. Writing unit tests has helped me catch potential issues early, especially for edge cases that I might not have considered otherwise. I also make it a point to validate user inputs and handle errors properly, ensuring the program runs smoothly while minimizing security risks. These habits give me confidence that the software I create is both reliable and safe to use.

I’ve found that understanding user needs starts with carefully breaking down the project requirements and user stories. In my Contact Service project, for example, I focused on making sure each contact had a unique ID and that fields like names and phone numbers weren’t left empty. I always try to put myself in the user’s shoes to anticipate their needs and use feedback to improve the program. This approach keeps me connected to the people who will actually use my software.

When designing software, I like to start by really understanding the problem at hand and then dividing it into smaller, manageable pieces. For instance, in the Contact Service project, I designed the Contact and ContactService classes separately to keep things organized and reusable. I also think about how the software might grow in the future and write clean, modular code to make updates easier down the line. For me, designing software is like solving a puzzle, it’s all about putting the right pieces in place to create something meaningful.
